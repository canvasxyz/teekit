## @teekit/tunnel

@teekit/tunnel is an encrypted channel that relays HTTP fetch requests
and WebSockets over a WebSocket, terminating inside a Trusted
Execution Environment. It uses @teekit/qvl for quote validation, and
additionally allows providing custom verifiers and TCB validation.

See the
[tests](https://github.com/canvasxyz/teekit/tree/main/packages/tunnel/test)
for usage examples.

For more information, see the [workspace
readme](https://github.com/canvasxyz/teekit) in Github.

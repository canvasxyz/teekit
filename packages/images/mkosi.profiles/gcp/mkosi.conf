# GCP profile configuration
# This file ensures reproducibility settings are properly inherited when using --profile=gcp
# The Seed must be explicitly set to match the base configuration for reproducible builds

[Output]
# Use the same Seed as base/mkosi.conf for reproducible builds
# Without this, mkosi may generate a different random seed when a profile is active
